Github Partnership agreement

1) General/Small updates
We do not have strict rules for small additions. We simply always run git pull before making changes
and git push after finishing work. This ensures we are able to make progress on the app with minimal
time spent on organizing git work flow. We for the most part work on different parts of the application
so we rarely run into merdge conflicts.

2) Large Features / Changes
Sometimes we will want to change or add large feautures which conflict with each others work. In this
case we dicuss the problem in class and decide the best way to impliment both features. Most of the 
time we do this by creating a branch. Then, once we meet together in class we merdge the branches 
in order to have up to date code bases. We usually do not code review before pulling and
just hope for the best. If merdge conflicts arise we work through them together. Lastly, we dicsuss the changes made and anything we need to keep in mind moving forward.
