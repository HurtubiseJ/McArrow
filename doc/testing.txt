Testing Features

1) Unit tests
    - We will use the React Native Testing library to write our tests. Default
      react native apps come with this library already installed. This will
      allow us to impliment functional and frontend formatting tests. For more
      diffcult features we might need to move to React Native Jest which provides
      additional testing features.

    - Unit tests will cover small integral components to our app, this includes:
        - Native location services, gyroscope, latitude, longitude
        - Bearing calculation
        - Google API service
        - Path tracking 
        - Path scoring
        
    - Because there is no "right answer" to most of the things we would test (Ex. the coordinates we pull from the device will constantly change) I think most of our tests will just make sure that the API calls are returns data in the correct format and not necessarily the correct data.
        
2) Manual tests
    - Navigation and button presses
    - User login (Can also be automated as unit test)
    - Making sure our arrow is actually pointing to the closest restaurant.
