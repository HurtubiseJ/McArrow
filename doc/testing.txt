Testing Features

1) Unit tests
    - Unit tests will cover small integral components to our app, this includes:
        - Native location services, gyroscope, latitude, longitude
        - Bearing calculation
        - Google API service
        - Path tracking 
        - Path scoring
    - Because there is no "right answer" to most of the things we would test (Ex. the coordinates we pull from the device will constantly change) I think most of our tests will just make sure that the API calls are returns data in the correct format and not necessarily the correct data.
        
2) Manual tests
    - Navigation and button presses
    - User login (Can also be automated as unit test)
    - Making sure our arrow is actually pointing to the closest restaurant.
