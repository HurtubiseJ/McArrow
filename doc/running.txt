== RUN WITH EXPO ==

1) Download expo CLI 
    - $ npm install -g expo-cli
    - $ expo --version (Check install)

2) Download expo app iOS or Android (we have only tested on iOS)
    - Go to app store and download the expo app 
    - Might need to make an account to test 

3) git clone https://github.com/HurtubiseJ/McArrow.git
    - cd into FrontendRN directory

4) Run application
    - $ npm install 
        - Install packages, might take a second 
    - $ npx expo start --clear
        - This should show a QR code along with more options
        - '-- clear' clears the cache (sometimes not clearing causes problems) 
        - NOTE: you may need to press the "s" key if it says "> Using development build"

5) Open camera on phone and scan terminal QR code (Do not close terminal process)
    - If you are testing on the Android expo app you will need to scan the QR code in the app 


== RUN WITH iOS emulator ==
1) Install XCode with iOS simulator

https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/

2) Download expo CLI 
    - $ npm install -g expo-cli
    - $ expo --version (Check install)

3) git clone https://github.com/HurtubiseJ/McArrow.git
    - cd into FrontendRN directory

4) Run application
    - $ npm install (Install packages)
    - $ npx expo start --clear
    - This should show a QR code along with more options

5) Click "i" key to open with iOS simulator

6) If those instructions don't work try running 'npx expo run:ios' in your terminal (in the FrontendRN directory)
    - This should compile the app to your simulator 
    - Once inside the simulator you will have to give it a fake location 
    - The gryoscope feature will not work in the simulator
