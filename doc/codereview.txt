=== DESCRIPTION and STATUS ===
Our app is McArrow. The primary functionality is an arrow which points towards 
a nearby store (default is mcdonalds). You are able to swipe left and right to 
the active store. To start a path you must click the arrow which starts a timer
in the top left. The goal is then to follow the straitest path to the selected 
location. On arrival, the app opens a map view to show your path along with a
path score. The score is a mixture of how well you stayed on course, distance 
traveled, and time to complete. The goal is to get the highest score!

Additionally, you can add custom locations. Swipe down on any arrow view to 
open the add location screen. Note: you cannot be in an activate path, meaning
there should be no timer in the top right. From this screen you can add a custom 
location with a color of your choosing. When the app is downloaded custom locations
will persist between sessions but using the simulator or expo go does not save locations.

All of the above features work in part from the scoreing algorithm. Currently it
only displays residuals (How far you went off the optimal path), time to complete, 
and distance. We will impliment the scoreing algorithm soon. 

We will also impliment a previous paths screen. This will show old paths and their
scores. This is currently not implimented. 

=== HOW TO RUN ===
I belive the easiest strategy is to use expo go. This also allows the use of the phones
gyroscopic features allowing full app functionality. If not possible you can still run
the app in XCode's iOS simulator with reduced functionality

SEE running.txt FOR STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS. 

=== QUESTIONS ===
1) How easy is it to figure out the app functionality? If we did not provide the description 
    above would you have been able to figure out page navigation and path starting?

2) In terms of UI do you have any suggestions, any pages you think aren't appealing?

3) Did you run into any errors? Any long bootstrapping phases?

=== OTHER ===
If you want to test without traveling very far I would recommend putting in "Carleton Gould Library"
as a custom location.
